# About

Daily Boulders is a SPA which allows users to create/view/update/delete their daily climbing grades.

## User Stories

-  As a user I want to sign/up/in/out and change my password.
-  As a user I want to log/see/edit/delete my climbs.
-  As a user, I don't want to refresh the page.
-  As a user, I don't want any bugs.

## Technology used

-  JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, JQuery, AJAX
-  Macbook Air
-  Google Chrome, Atom

## Steps of development:

1. I started by planning on paper and read the requirements a few times before outlining all the steps in order that I would follow.
2. Worked on the back end first. Created one resource at a time, testing all CRUD and then built the relation between the user and the climb. Then I tested the relationship.
3. Did the auth on the front end and tested each method.
4. Created the CRUD on the front end and tested them all.
5. tested the auth and the CRUD together to make sure that the climbs were owned by their users.

## With more time I would...

- Create a leaderboard where users can see the top daily/weekly/monthly entries of all users. Maybe include a chart of the results too.
- Have a small calendar popup when user chooses date.
