# About

Daily Boulders is a SPA which allows users to create/view/update/delete their daily climbing grades.

## User Stories

-  As a user I want to sign/up/in/out and change my password.
-  As a user I want to log/see/edit/delete my climbs.
-  As a user, I don't want to refresh the page.
-  As a user, I don't want any bugs.

## Technology used

-  JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, JQuery, AJAX
-  Macbook Air
-  Google Chrome, Atom

## With more time I would...

- Create a leaderboard where users can see the top daily/weekly/monthly entries of all users. Maybe include a chart of the results too.
- Have a small calendar popup when user chooses date.
